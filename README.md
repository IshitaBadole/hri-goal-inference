## Controllers

### ped_controller_v1.py

A controller for a webots pedestrian object. It moves all the joints of the pedestrian while walking, and also reports the (x,y,z) position of the pedestrian at all times. 

## Path Finding

### A*

Implementation of A* algorithm on a 2D grid. This is derived from the homework from CSCI 5302:Advance Robotics.

### Dijkstra's algorithm

Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm on a 2D grid. This is derived from the homework from CSCI 5302:Advance Robotics.

### RRT

Implementation of RRT (holonomic and non-holonomic) algorithm on a 2D grid. This is derived from the homework from CSCI 5302:Advance Robotics. We would we using the holonimic implementation of RRT.
